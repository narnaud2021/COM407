This is a  genetic algorithm (GA) that learns the parameters for a production system to 
evolve an XPilot agent.


 -GA_controller.py implements genetic algorithm operators: selection, 
crossover, mutation, etc. to evolve an Xpilot agent. Variables such as input soze may be changed. 
Best ndividual of a population is written to a text file over genrations as well as the chromosome 
for each individual in the population.

-chromosome.py is the hardcoded chromosome we used to run the GA_controller because we did not have 
enough time to ompletely train the set. However, we will submit the trained set tonight.
